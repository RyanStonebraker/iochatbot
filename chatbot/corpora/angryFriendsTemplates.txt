Uh-uh. See, I see... big passion in your future.
Really?
mmm.
You do?
I do.
Oh Ross, you're so great.
It's never gonna happen.
What?
You and Rachel.
What? Why not?
Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
Yeeeaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
Shhhh!
What are you shushing?
We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?
Ahhhh!
See?
Huh.
Would you like some gum?
Um, is it sugarless?
The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off.
Sorry, it's not.
Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy... la la la, la la, la la...
OK, here goes.
Are you going to do it?
The best fighter is never angry.
I'm going to do it.
Do you want any help?
Bitterness is like cancer. It eats upon the host. But anger is like fire. It burns it all clean.
Donâ€™t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.
You come out there, you're a dead man.
Good luck, man.
Thanks. OK.
OK.
Hey, where are you going?
Outside.
You can't go out there.
Why not?
Because of... the reason.
And that would be?
When angry, count four. When very angry, swear.
I, um, can't tell you.
Joey, what's going on?
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
About what?
Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.
He's planning your birthday party.
Most misunderstandings in the world could be avoided if people would simply take the time to ask, "What else could this mean?"
Oh my God! I love him!
You'd better act surprised.
About what?
My surprise party!
What surprise party?
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Well, he didn't tell me.
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
Hmmm... this is so nice.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
OK.
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...
Ohhh!
Yes, yes, that's right...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What? Ow!
Anger is like flowing water.
I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Sorry, that was wax.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Yeah?
Learn this from me. Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from inside. We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade. And the harm we do, we do to ourselves.
Usually when people are sad, they don't do anything. They just cry over their condition. But when they get angry, they bring about a change.
You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Er, yeah, it's mine.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Wait a minute. What's his name?
Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Red is the color of blood.
Bob Buttons?
Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Ooh! You are a very bad man!
You owe me a cat.
Here, kitty kitty. Here kitty kitty. Where did you go, little kitty kitty kitty? Here kitty kitty kitty kitty...
Wow.
Lucky sixes...
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Hi!
And Joey...
Hi!
And Ross.
Hi!
He doesn't speak much English.
Monopoly!
Look at that!
So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Oh... Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
That, that is funny... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
You betcha!
Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Are you alright?
My God, you're choking! That better?
Yes... thank you. That was... that was...
Perfection?
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaah...
WhaWhat did he say that was so funny?
I have absolutely no idea.
That's... that's classic.
Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
If you want, I'll do it.
Never respond to an angry person with a fiery comeback, even if he deserves it...Don't allow his anger to become your anger.
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooddddddd...
Paolo. Hi.
Ross!
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Thing?
People are angry.
Thing, yes. Thing.
Ah, you... have the sex?
No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the... um...
Bed?
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Oh!
Yeah! Se vice?
Si.
So you do know a little English.
Poco... a leetle.
Do you know the word crapweasel?
No.
That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
OK.
Ready?
No, you've got to whip it.
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48...
Thank you.
Whoa, who peed in your Cheerios?
Thanks.
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Bwah-hah-hah!
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooo-hah-hah...
Oh.. oh... oh.
How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Well, this has been fun.
Anger is like a storm rising up from the bottom of your consciousness. When you feel it coming, turn your focus to your breath.
A void in my chest was beginning to fill with anger.
When angry count to ten before you speak. If very angry, count to one hundred.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Hey gorgeous, how's it going?
The world is stupid.
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Do you want a date Saturday?
Yes please.
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's
He's a he?
Well yeah! ...Oh God. I just I thought Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
You did?
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
I did.
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Not me.
I hate everything.
no no, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
Yeah! Right!
WHAT IS IT?!
Okay, I d'know, you just you have a quality.
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
So, uh, how's she doing?
Never go to bed angry, stay up and fight.
I believe anger is a wasted emotion, and I donâ€™t like to waste emotions.
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
How are you, Mom?
Every time you get angry, you poison your own system.
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here...What's with your hair?
Anger does not solve problems â€“ anger only makes things worse. I go by the old saying, Donâ€™t make important decisions when youâ€™re angry.
What?
What's different?
Nothing.
If you are patient in one moment of anger, you will escape a hundred days of sorrow.
Oh, maybe that's it.
Anger is an unnecessary emotion. Loads of stuff in life can trigger it, but what matters is how you react. I choose not to react.
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Oh God!
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from restaurants.
Not just restaurants, from our house.
Mrs. Geller?
She looks so small.
I know.
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
G'bye, Nana.
Bye, Nana.
Ross!
What is going on?!
Y'know how the nurse said that that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
What?
She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
What's going on?
She may have died.
She may have died?
We're looking into it.
I, uh, I'll go see.
This almost never happens!
Now she's passed.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
So, um, did she...
Twice.
Twice?
Oh, that sucks!
You guys okay?
I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
no no, she's gone.
We checked. A lot.
Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
Thanks!
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Anger is a killing thing: it kills the man who angers, for each rage leaves him less than he had been before â€“ it takes something from him.
Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!

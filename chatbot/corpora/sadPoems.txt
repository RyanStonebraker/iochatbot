Im just a poor girl   
        Living in this rich world   
        Started with   So much   
        But   Left with   So little   
        Theres nothing inside   
        At some point   
        Every rose will die    (has to die)


        Everythings gone now   
        Torn from inside me   
        Every rose   blooms   
        With beauty and   grace   
        But   
        With lack of 'love' and care   
        It dies

        You cant just go
        And leave me here


        Staring at the glass
        Infront of me
        Thinking to myself
        This is where you should be


        If you leave me tonight
        I'll wake up alone
        Knowing that this
        Is no longer my home

        Do you remember?
        All that we did? !
        All the places we hid? !


        I'd skip a stone   
        You'd pull me near   
        And whisper sweet words   
        In my ear   !


        Every breath that you'd take   
        I knew my heart would break   
        Harderer we would and did fall   
        When we no longer had it all   !

     
        A Way   

        To   drink down poison would be too easy,
        To   slit my wrists would be too hard,
        To   hold my breath an impossible way,
        To   try and stop my beating heart   


        To hang from a rope a waste of time,
        To jump from a cliff   just might be fine,
        But all you’d have to do is   
        Say you didn’t love me anymore   ! ! !

        I dont have a home
        Im do it my way
        Im always alone


        Just when its getting good
        I slowly start to freeze
        Just when its feeling real
        I put my heart to sleep


        Please understand
        I never ment to push you away
        I dont know why

        Like a little dog
        Always hiding

        You never wanted me
        Just to love
        Wouldent set me free

        You were lonely, draped in sorrow…
        I was trapped…
        Fascinated by your darker side…
        Alluring in your strangeness…


        I’m looking into a mirror…
        Remembering…
        It was all just lies…
        The mirror falls…as I recall…

        It will all become clear…

        Pulling myself apart today,
        To see whats underneath,
        Idolise the things I say,
        Its all a mystery to me,
        Lost like a ship, without a sail,
        Im terrified to fail,
        Its just to hard to see,
        Who I am and when,
        Will I be found,
        What if I drown?
        Im going under now! !

        You’re made of glass…!
        So…be careful…

        Look what you’ve done…
        It’s only a chip…

        I no it’s not the way…
        But it’s all I have today…


        To take a road that leads nowhere…
        Would be better then walking my life…
        For if I was to write it down…
        The conclusion would involve a knife…


        As much you hate to read these words…
        I hate to write them more…
        For this is telling of my life…
        Showing it to all   


        Protected…I never was…
        But I always held up a shield…
        Until they came and tore it down…
        Leaving me reveled…


        How do I rid of these images…?
        Those have haunted me for years…?
        Get rid of them…
        Finally…


        If I try…
        Will they go…be suddenly erased…?
        Or will they replay themselves…?
        Day after day after day…!


        All of these questions I cannot answer…!
        Not for you and not for myself…!
        I can only wish that soon the will…

        All you did was…blame me…
        And wait for me to fall…
        Silent whispers…give a shove…
        Falling to the floor…


        Making love…intent to hurt…
        Don’t worry…I’ll not speak a word…
        I’m tired of being here…
        Won’t wait another year…


        Once more I crawl inside my hole…
        I take a vow of loneliness…
        I’m always never, not no more…
        So with that…I take my final bow…

        A violin   
        Turning my heart
        Further in
        You never said

        I put up with you
        Everyday
        Always listened
        Played your way
        It was because

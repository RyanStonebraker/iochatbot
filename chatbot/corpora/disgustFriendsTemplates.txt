Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Why not?
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
I could do that.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
STOP IT! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Monica? You're Mom.
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Oh my God! Whoah!
Well, what's the part?
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!
Seriously, what's the part?
Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!
C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
...I'm his
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then I'm his butt.
Oh my God.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Alright, alright, alright...
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
For what?
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Thank you!
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes! My eyes!
I am unable to understand how a man of honor could take a newspaper in his hands without a shudder of disgust.
I warned you...
Hypocrite reader my fellow my brother!
At the end of the day your ability to connect with your readers comes down to how you make them feel.
Who is being loud?
Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
The old endless chain of love, tolerance, indifference, aversion and disgust.
No, no, don't let my vulnerable heart share in this sacrifice to lust! Let him disgust me before pleasing me! Let him be what others have been, an instrument that I can break before becoming the echoes of its vibration.
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
I am hard to disgust, but a pretentious poet can do it.
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the the old Monica would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Lose the robe.
Me?
That would work.
Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action.
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
Well, I'm I'm showering.
No, that was clenching.
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action...and cut. What was that?
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
God, I love these fingers...
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him.
Thank you.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
Oh my God, I'm late.
Oh no no no no, don't go..
Okay.
Above all, avoid lying, especially lying to yourself.
Don't go.
If someone calls you disgusting, they are lusting.
Okay. Oh no, I have to.
Sex. You can't lie to yourself sexually. If you don't want it, it's the most disgusting thing in the world.
Oh, I know that she's disgusted, cause she's feeling so abused.
Too bad, she's leaving.
Love is a disease.
Today we recognize that the emotion of disgust evolved as an unconscious defense against biological contamination.
What I learned about pigeons turned my revulsion into curiosity, and then, gradually, admiration.
All those big words produce disgust today.
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
When a person uses his or her position of power from a church, corporation, or government to throw disgust upon a person for holding a different perspective, the person with the position of power is using lust as a mindset to gain control over the masses.
Well, I thought I thought you talked to Rick.
It's not Rick.
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
No, it's it's Andrew.
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
He's... new.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
No, that's not exactly what I was..
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
So what do you want?
You.
You have me!
no no, just you.
Whaddyou mean?
Lose the other guys.
...Like, ...all of them?
C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
I don't know, I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
Which one?
...The second guy.
Well, call me if you change your mind.
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Hey!
Hey, wait wait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Nope.
No? What happened, big guy?
Big guy?
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
I got fired.
Oh!
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
My mom will.
Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Hard to tell, I was naked.
No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Yeah? That's so nice!
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
The vine bears three kinds of grapes: the first of pleasure, the second of intoxication, the third of disgust.
Night.
When I look upon seamen, men of science and philosophers, man is the wisest of all beings; when I look upon priests and prophets nothing is as contemptible as man.
Uh, Mon, you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Uh-huh!
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
She is a kook.
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song That's about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
Oh, great. This is just...
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Wow, you guys, this is big.
Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Well, I never call me.
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
Hi everyone.
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
That had to hurt!
Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
There you go!
You're definitely scaring here.
Would you like to call somebody?
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
Hello?

It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.

Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Alright, somebody.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Whoooaa!
I am so disgusted.
That's my sister.
OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Pheebs, what about you?
Oh... Milwaukee.
Um... Ross?
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
No way!
The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Oh, Rachel.
Oh come on, I already went.
You did not go!
Come on.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... oh, the foot of the bed.
Step back.
I scoff at people.
We have a winner!
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Come on.
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
And you didn't marry him because...?
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Yeah right.
It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
OK.
But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
You don't.

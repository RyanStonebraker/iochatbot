Your smile is a million suns
The galaxy never knows night
When you're happy.



The person who always 
knows when something’s the matter 
But doesn’t pry because time will tell 

The beauty you hold 
doesn’t just come from the outside 
But It is flowing within  

You have a kind heart that not everyone 
Deserves to see but you show it to anyone
You think needs a pick me up 

Everything you’d want in a best friend 
Could be found in you
So I worry about you going away 

I could never get tired of our late night talks 
The ones where we just lay in the dark
Because I can tell you anything and everything 

But as it turns out 
Everyone has a different definition of forever 
And I hate that I’m waiting to see what yours is



Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened



You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life



Happiness is a warm puppy



Choose to be optimistic, it feels better



It doesn’t matter how slow you go, as long as you don’t stop



The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away



Just because you fail once doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything



Everything is amazing all the time



What a wonderful life I’ve had!



Everything is awesome, everything is cool when your part of a team
Everything is awesome, when you're living out a dream
Everything is better when we stick together
Some have said you and I are gonna win forever?
Lets party forever
We're the same unlike you, you're like me we're all working in harmony
Everything is awesome, everything is cool when your part of a team
Everything is awesome, when you're living out a dream
Woo! 3, 2, 1, go!
Have you heard the news? Everyone's talkin'
Life is good 'cause everything awesome
Lost my job, there's a new opportunity
More free time for my awesome community
I feel more awesome than an awesome possum
Dip my body in chocolate frostin'
Three years later wash off the frostin'
Smellin' like a blossom, everything is awesome
Stepped in mud, got new brown shoes
It's awesome to win and it's awesome to lose
Everything is better when we stick together
Side by side, you and I gonna win forever?
Let's party forever
We're the same unlike you, you're like me we're all working in harmony
Everything is awesome, everything is cool when your part of a team
Everything is awesome, when you're living out a dream
Blue skies, bouncy springs, we just named a few awesome things
A Nobel prize, a piece of string
You know what's awesome? Everything!
Dogs with fleas, allergies
A book of Greek antiquities
Brand new pants, a very old vest
Awesome items are the best
Trees, (frogs), clogs, they're awesome
Rocks, clocks, and socks, they're awesome
Figs, and jigs, and twigs, that's awesome
Everything you see or think or say is awesome
Everything is awesome, everything is cool when your part of a team
Everything is awesome, when you're living out a dream

Go out and smash it like oh my God
Jump off that sofa, let's get, get off
I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out spaced out and losing all control
Fill up my cup, Mazel Tov
Look at her dancing, just take it off
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof, and then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
And do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
Cause I gotta feeling, woohoo,
That tonight's gonna be a good night

I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way

Injust a small town girl,
livin' in a lonely world
she took the midnight train goin' anywhere...
just a city boy,
born and raised in south detroithe
took the midnight train goin' anywhere...
a singer in a smokey room,
the smell of wine and cheap perfumefor
a smile they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on...
strangers waiting,
up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlight people,
living just to find emotion
hiding, somewhere in the night
working hard to get my fill,
everybody wants a thrillpayin'
anything to roll the dice,
just one more time
some will win, some will lose
some were born to sing the blues
oh, the movie never ends
it goes on and on and on and on
strangers waiting,
up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlight people,
living just to find emotion
hiding, somewhere in the night
don't stop believin'
hold on to the feelin'
streetlight people


Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dream of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dream of
Dreams really do come true
Someday, I wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dare to
Oh why, oh why can't I?
Well, I see trees of green and red roses too
I'll watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Well, I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white
And the brightness of day
I like the dark
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
And also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands saying
How do you do?
They're really saying I, I love you
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more then we'll know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
World
Someday I wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top
That's where you'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dare to
Why oh, why can't I?
